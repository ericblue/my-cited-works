This week marks the 20th anniversary of my journey in online writing and open-source development. What began in 2004 as a simple blog has evolved into a body of work that has been referenced across academia, including books, theses, research papers, art exhibits, and global research projects. These works span diverse topics such as the Quantified Self, Knowledge Management, Mind Mapping, EEG, and more.

To commemorate this milestone, Iâ€™ve compiled a summary and list of all these cited works, which you can explore here in this repository. My contributions, often the result of late-night tinkering or multi-year projects, continue to inspire and support others in their own creative and research endeavors.

As I continue to create and share, I encourage others to follow their passions. You never know the lasting impact your work might have.
